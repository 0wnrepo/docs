# Integrations

## Public chains

Oraclize is integrated natively with the most widely used public blockchain instances like the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Rootstock mainnets and testnets.

## Private chains

By using the Oraclize stargate tool it is possible to connect any private blockchain instance to the Oraclize engine.

## Non-blockchain

Thanks to the features provided by the oraclize-lib, it is possible to fully leverage the Oraclize service potential in any non blockchain context as well.
