# Integrations

## Public Chains
Oraclize is integrated natively with the most widely used public blockchain protocols like the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Rootstock mainnets and testnets.

## Private Ethereum-based Chains
Private, Ethereum-based chains can currently integrate with Oraclize by using the Ethereum-Bridge. Forks of Ethereum such as Monax included. More information on how to use the Ethereum-Bridge is available in the dedicated [section](#development-tools). 

## Alternative Private Chains
The Oraclize team is currently investigating to create software for a native integration for alternative private distributed ledger protocols such as Corda, Chain and Hyperledger. Additional information are available on contacts. 

## Non-blockchain
The oraclize-lib enables the use of the Oraclize engine capabilities also in a non-blockchain context, by providing an abstraction layer which resolves to Oraclize HTTP API. The oraclize-lib is currently in a experimental-stage.
