# &#9784; &nbsp; Rootstock

When launched later this year, Rootstock will be the first production sidechain of the Bitcoin network. It aims to extends Bitcoin capabilities without compromising its decentralization and censorship resistance properties. On the Rootstock networks, participants will be able to interact with smart contracts using a token called Smart Bitcoin.
The peg between Bitcoin and Smart Bitcoins is maintained by a federation of distinguished players, among which Oraclize will proudly figure, and backed by merged mining.

The RSK team has recently launched the Ginger Testnet, which has full integration with Oraclize services.

Smart contracts on Rootstock are executed by an upgraded, but backward compatible version, of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Oraclize Rootstock integration is in fact completely compatible with the Ethereum one, since Ethereum smart contract can be compiled and execute on Rootstock natively.
