# Introduction

## Welcome to Oraclize's documentation!

Oraclize is a <u title="(the amount of trust involved is close to zero)">provably-honest oracle</u> service enabling smart contracts to access the Internet.

We are platform-agnostic by providing an abstraction interface to all the major smart-contracts capable platforms out there (Bitcoin and Ethereum for now).
We think that it's just by throwing tons of meaningful data into the blockchain jar that the smart contracts industry can flourish and many useful applications can finally come to life.


While any platform is providing access to on-chain data only, Oraclize provides to them an interface to any data-feed on the Internet.


This documentation covers our API integration with the **Ethereum** platform.
