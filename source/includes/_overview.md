# Overview
Oraclize aims to be the privileged data gateway between blockchain protocols and the world wide web. 

Oraclize main goal as a company is to provide a way for smart contracts to break free of their constrains and provide them the ability to access all the data they need from the web, without compromising their trustless nature. 

In particular, the aim is not to force smart contract developers in having to trust Oraclize with the data they need. Without any backing of authenticity, Oraclize could easily tamper with the data.

In order to complete this complex task, Oraclize returns the data requested along with a proof of the authenticity: i.e that the data comes from the data provider which has been explicity demanded by the smart contract.

More can be read about the authenticity proofs provided by Oraclize, within the dedicated Authencity Proofs section of this documentation.

# Getting Started
The following documentation enables developers to start integrating Oraclize into their project. 

The service is currently live on Bitcoin, Ethereum's mainnet and testnet and Rootstock's testnet.
