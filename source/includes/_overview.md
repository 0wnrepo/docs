# Overview
Oraclize aims to become the privileged data gateway between blockchain protocols and the world wide web. 
Our main goal as a company is to provide a way for smart contracts to break free of their walled gardens and make them able to access all the data they need from the web, without compromising their trustless nature. In particularour aim is not to force smart contract developers to have to trust Oraclize, and Oraclize infrastructure, with the data they need. Without any form of authenticated data, Oraclize could easily tamper and change the data itself.
In order to complete this difficult task, Oraclize, when fetching data, it returns it along with a proof of the data authenticity: i.e the data comes from the datasource which has been explicity demanded by the smart contract.
You can read more about our authenticity proof in the dedicated section in our documentation.

# Getting Started
The following documentation enables a developer to start integrating Oraclize in their project. 
Our service is currently live on Bitcoin and Ethereum main and testnet networks, and also on Rootstock project testnet. We will likely have further network integrations in the future.

For easier accessibility,  the documentation is divided in the follwing sections:
